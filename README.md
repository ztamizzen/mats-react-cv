# CV of Mats Lindblad

Written using React, Redux and Brunch.io.

## Brunch with Sangria

Serve brunch the way brunch should be served, with:

- Babel/ES6
- React
- Redux
- jQuery
- Twitter Bootstrap
- Sass support
- Airbnb ESLint

This is a modern JS skeleton for [Brunch](http://brunch.io).

### Installation

Clone this repo manually or use `brunch new DIRECTORY -s brunch-with-sangria`

### Getting started

- Install (if you don't have them):
  - [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): `brew install node` on OS X
  - [Brunch](http://brunch.io): `npm install -g brunch`
  - Brunch plugins and app dependencies: `npm install`

- Run:
  - `npm start` — watches the project with continuous rebuild. This will also launch HTTP server with [pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history).
  - `npm run build` — builds minified project for production

- Learn:
  - `public/` dir is fully auto-generated and served by HTTP server.  Write your code in `app/` dir.
  - Place static files you want to be copied from `app/assets/` to `public/`.
